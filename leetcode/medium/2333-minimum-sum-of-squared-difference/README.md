# Minimum Sum of Squared Difference

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given two positive  **0-indexed**  integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, both of length `n`.

The  **sum of squared difference**  of arrays `nums1` and `nums2` is defined as the  **sum**  of `(nums1[i] - nums2[i])2` for each `0 <= i < n`.

You are also given two positive integers `k1` and `k2`. You can modify any of the elements of `nums1` by `+1` or `-1` at most `k1` times. Similarly, you can modify any of the elements of `nums2` by `+1` or `-1` at most `k2` times.

Return  *the minimum  **sum of squared difference**  after modifying array* `nums1` *at most* `k1` *times and modifying array* `nums2` *at most* `k2` *times*.

 **Note** : You are allowed to modify the array elements to become  **negative**  integers.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,4], nums2 = [2,10,20,19], k1 = 0, k2 = 0
Output: 579
Explanation: The elements in nums1 and nums2 cannot be modified because k1 = 0 and k2 = 0. 
The sum of square difference will be: (1 - 2)2 + (2 - 10)2 + (3 - 20)2 + (4 - 19)2 = 579.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums1 = [1,4,10,12], nums2 = [5,8,6,9], k1 = 1, k2 = 1
Output: 43
Explanation: One way to obtain the minimum sum of square difference is: 
- Increase nums1[0] once.
- Increase nums2[2] once.
The minimum of the sum of square difference will be: 
(2 - 5)2 + (4 - 8)2 + (10 - 7)2 + (12 - 9)2 = 43.
Note that, there are other ways to obtain the minimum of the sum of square difference, but there is no way to obtain a sum smaller than 43.
```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- n == nums1.length == nums2.length
- 1 <= n <= 105
- 0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 105
- 0 <= k1, k2 <= 109

public class Solution
{
    public long MinSumSquareDiff(int[] nums1, int[] nums2, int k1, int k2)
    {
        long operations = (long)k1 + k2;
        int[] freq = new int[100001];
        int maxDiff = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums1.Length; i++)
        {
            int diff = Math.Abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i]);
            freq[diff]++;
            maxDiff = Math.Max(maxDiff, diff);
        }

        for (int d = maxDiff; d > 0 && operations > 0; d--)
        {
            long count = freq[d];
            long use = Math.Min(count, operations);

            freq[d] -= (int)use;
            freq[d - 1] += (int)use;
            operations -= use;
        }

        long answer = 0;

        for (int d = 1; d < freq.Length; d++)
        {
            answer += (long)d * d * freq[d];
        }

        return answer;
    }
}
